# Phixyn's Dotfiles

Just the way I like things :coffee:

Configuration files that I use on Linux OSs, BSD and MacOS.

## Contents

* bin folder containing setup and helper scripts
* i3 WM configs
* Ranger FM configs
* `.Xresources` for X applications
* `.bashrc` for bash on Linux
* `.bash_profile` for bash on MacOS
* `Brewfile` for quickly installing applications on MacOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* `.vimrc` and `vim-setup.sh` :purple_heart:

### AppleScript vs. 'Login Items'

**What is the advantage of `morning.applescript` versus MacOS' 'Login Items' feature?**

You can run commands and scripts via iTerm2 (or any terminal emulator) and get your development environment ready in milliseconds. This is handy when you have virtual environments or need to SSH into other machines, which is my case. This saves me a lot of typing and time in the mornings.

Another advantage is that you don't have to manually add all your applications to the 'Login Items' in System Preferences every time you set up a new Mac.
